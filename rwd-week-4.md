# RWD Week Four

## Adding your media

## Hero image 

We

- If you are struggling to create a high quality hero image (you really should try) - you can download and use [a free hero image from Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/hero-image). 
- You can [resize the big header image](http://www.simpleimageresizer.com/) and [compress the image](https://tinyjpg.com/) without necessarily needing Photoshop.
- Remember to keep the full size original image.
- *Alt text* - background images do not have (or need) alt text. However, that means you should not *hide* anything in the image you need your user to read.
- You might want to modify the image so that there is enough contrast between the foreground and background. One way of doing this is by using photoshop, or you could [try using a 'background-blend-mode' in CSS](https://codepen.io/wilsondmmu/pen/XZrBzd).

INSERT - DEMO VIDEO OF ABOVE.

INSERT - WE NEED VIDEOS OF BOTH OF THESE PROCESSES FOR THE FIRST TERM ANYWAY. ALSO NEED A VIDEO OF SAVE FOR THE WEB PROCESS IN PHOTOSHOP.

- Style the text of your header. Think about font size, spacing, font weight.

SHOULD WE ADD TEXT SHADOW OR SUCH AS AN OPTION? OR DO WE HAVE A LINK OR TWO OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES?

- Test your header by changing the size of the browser window.

ARE WE GOING TO SUGGEST A DIFFERENT SIZE FOR LARGER SCREENS? OR DO WE ADD THIS LATER?
