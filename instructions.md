# Steps

## Week 4

This week you should be getting close to a completed layout, or at least have an idea of all the tools you'll need to complete your layout. Most of your work this week will probably be on the site header and/or changing things you've done with floats or display:inline-block to flexbox.

1. Use one of the new units we discussed to give your page header prominence on the page. 
2. Think about where you can use background images and implement them.
3. Sort out your navigation - try using flexbox. Remember that you need to make sure it works at all screen sizes.
4. Validate your pages and your CSS: it's easy for errors to creep in as you're working on your site.
5. Once you've finished the site, leave it a few days and come back to it. Is there anything you can improve?

You will have some time after the CSS lectures are finished before we start on Javascript and jQuery. The more you have done now, the easier it will be to add the javascript interactions and understand what they are working on.

## Week 3

We'll go through the kind of thing you should be seeing after completing the list above in the lecture this week. After the lecture the next jobs are:

1. Add the max-width for images to your CSS.
2. Format your contact us form's labels. You could also add padding, font-size and other styling to the `input` and `textarea` elements on the contact form.
3. Use floats and media queries to turn the three image gallery images into a row of three across at the breakpoint you judge to be right.
4. Think about how you can use media queries in other places on your site with a mobile-first approach.

## Week 2

Now you have downloaded the template, you might want to approach working on your site in this order:

1. Look through the code and research any tags you aren't familiar with.
2. Create a stylesheet and add a simple rule (e.g. turn all the text red) to make sure the two files are linked up correctly.
3. Add your content, including images. Proofread and validate.
4. Turn on the border-box model in your stylesheet. [Use this blog post from CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/) to get the code you'll need. You're looking for the 'the current frontrunner for best practice'.
5. Use the pattern we learned today to make the About Us, Work Experience, Image Gallery and Contact form sections responsive. **Tip**: try adding the pattern to the `.container-content` divs to see what happens.
6. Check your work in the [Chrome Responsive](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/) mode.
7. Work on your font sizing and font choice for your page. Add font sizes in rems ([Read more about rems](https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem)) to your headings/text you want to be smaller. Remember to keep it relative.
8. Have a go at adding some background colours to 'zone' the page. The CSS you need is `background-color:red` or similar. Add the background colour to the relevant sections using the right classnames as from the lecture.
9. Think about the white space on your page - the padding and margins. You might want to put more margins or padding around each section. Try a few different approaches and see what works, especially on the `div`s with background colours.
