# RWD Week Four

# Warning - these materials will not be complete until Monday 28th January 2019

## Menu and contact form

## Add the menu layout

- [The menu layout code is available here](https://codepen.io/wilsondmmu/pen/KXRLoW). Only copy what you need.
- Check it works by changing the size of the browser window
- Adjust the breakpoint if it doesn't fit your design
- Look at your menu in context of the rest of your site. Does it need different colours? Borders? Check the 'hover state': what could could you use for the hover?
- You might like to try using [position:fixed](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/position/#article-header-id-2) and a [box-shadow](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/) to make your menu 'stick' to the top of the page in your larger screen media query (We're not too worried about full browser compatibility for box shadow, just a box-shadow line in your CSS will be fine).  

## Tweak your form

At the moment your form is being styled by the browser default styles. These (as you can see) are pretty awful. Applying some simple styling to a form not only makes it look better (more professional), but also can make it more usable.

- [Use this code](https://codepen.io/wilsondmmu/pen/yMOjra) as a starting point for your form
- Set your form submit button to a contrasting colour

## Metadata

`<meta name="description" content="Add your meta description">`

- Meta description - create and insert a relevant description. As this is the homepage, the description would be of the site as a whole. Descriptions between 50–300 characters. For a deeper understanding see [the MOZ SEO Meta Description Guide](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description).

`<title>A website</title>`

- Title - The homepage `<title>` should set a content for the whole site. It can be expanded upon in the meta description. This is easy if you are the BBC or Nike, or your name is fairly distinctive (Richard Eskins?). Otherwise this can be tough. Any sub-pages should start 'function first', for example `Contact - Richard Eskins`. To understand the importance of the title read the [the MOZ SEO Guide to the title tag](https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag).

## SEO - your content

On-site SEO refers to optimizing both the content and HTML source code of a page. The content you have created will also add to the value and 'findability' of your site.

The [MOZ SEO Guide](https://moz.com/learn/seo/on-site-seo) explains:

- **In-depth**."Thin" content was one of Google Panda's specific targets; today it's more or less assumed that content must be sufficiently thorough in order to stand a good chance at ranking.
- **User-friendly**. Is the content readable? Is it organized on your site in such a way that it's easily navigable? Is it generally clean, or littered with ads and affiliate links?
- **Unique**. If not properly addressed, content duplicated from elsewhere on your site (or elsewhere on the Internet) may impact a site's ability to rank on SERPs.
- **Authoritative and trustworthy**. Does your content stand on its own as a reliable resource for information on a particular topic?
- **Aligned with user search intent**. Part of creating and optimizing for quality content is also delivering on searcher expectations. Content topics should align with the search queries for which they rank.


## Social media

You should add links to your professional social media accounts. This is usually done via clickable icons. Use a [site like iconmonstr](https://iconmonstr.com/) to customise and download a png file, or to embed inline code for an svg.

Want to know more about svg? Read the [MDN guide to Adding vector graphics to the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Adding_vector_graphics_to_the_Web).
